            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>In my free time, I find joy in spending moments of solitude, which allows me to recharge and reflect. During these quiet hours, I often engage in cleaning and organizing my home, as I believe that a tidy environment fosters creativity and clarity of mind. This process not only brings a sense of order to my living space but also instills a feeling of accomplishment and calm.

                Additionally, I am passionate about reading and exploring new literary genres. Whether it's fiction, non-fiction, or poetry, I find that reading expands my perspective and ignites my imagination. I enjoy delving into stories that challenge my thoughts and introduce me to new ideas, as well as books that enhance my personal and professional development. This combination of activities—cleaning, reading, and enjoying my own company—contributes to my overall well-being and inspires my work.
